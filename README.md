# Homebrew/command-not-found (merged into Homebrew/brew)

This tap provided Ubuntu's `command-not-found` functionality to Homebrew users.
It has been entirely merged into [Homebrew/brew](https://github.com/Homebrew/brew).
`brew which-formula` and the shell integration still works as before, it just isn't in this tap any more.
